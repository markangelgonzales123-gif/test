clarifications:

"strategic core and functions" because it susubmits docs even tho it have blank values

"back button" after getting back from printing, should exit straight to dashboard landing page

"1 user submit" dates are the only needs to change kasi maling docs may annualy at semi annual

"summary ratings". current IPCR calculation is wrong. it sticks to the 45%, 45%, 10% weighted average instead of 55% ,45% when chosing in the dropdown under "Weight Distribution"

"once dean approve"
needs an editable file even tho employee already submitted(have status if checked or nah instead of approved) because once approved, it should not be editable anymore

"print only the report"
table only in print, ok format but needs to fix the text boxes appearance

"approved period" date of approval 

"printing" layout, need fixing because some documents are landscape, some are not, some have different paper size

"new form in idp"
after employee submitted just have "accomplished" table 

"DPCR -OP" remove "review now" badge once clicked the file (instead of 2 days passing before removal)

"consolidated dpcr"
option for printing to all the files in president role which is consolidation of all. not a page-per-page or per-document
